This is a simple Plug-in for Photoshop that creates a folder named "hotfolder" on User's desktop.

Follow the steps below for the plug in to work.

  a. Download the files.

  b. Navigate to your photoshop installation folder. Usually "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024\Plug-ins". Your photoshop version mighy vary.

  c. Create a folder named "Hotfolder" in the plugins folder and copy the files in the "Holfolder" folder.

  d. Open Photoshop and Navigate to "Plugins" menu and you will see the plug in entry there.

  e. Click on the Start Monitoring button for Photoshop to start the plugin.

You will see 2 drop downs. First will be your Action Set, if you have multiple sets you can use the drop down to select the desired set

In the second drop down you will see the actions in that particular set. Select the desired action.

Now when ever you transfer a file in the "hotfolder" on your desktop, photoshop will automatically open the file and run the selected action on it.

After it has finished the action it will move the file to the "_processed" folder inside the hotfolder.

*Note: I am just a photographer who had left developing and coding 8 years ago and completely out of loop. I used Cursor AI to code this plug in just as a side project.
